##  🌱 Future Enhancements


You can enhance and scale the project with the following features:

###   🔢 1. Dynamic Number of Players
Let users choose the number of players (e.g., 2–4)
Assign unique symbols (e.g., X, O, A, B)
Update game logic to handle multiple players and turn rotation

###   🧮 2. NxN Board Support
Let users input board size (e.g., 4x4, 5x5, NxN)
Dynamically calculate win condition (e.g., N in a row to win)
Update input handling, board display, and win-checking logic

###   🧠 3. Single Player Mode (AI)
Add an AI opponent using:
Easy: Random moves
Medium: Rule-based
Hard: Minimax algorithm
